## About Me

I'm a **DevOps and Delivery Coach and Consultant**, focused on **teams** and **flow** first. I help organizations adopt test automation and continuous delivery, as well as **understand** **DevOps from both technical and human perspectives**. 

I'm a regular speaker and author ([InfoQ](https://www.infoq.com/profile/Manuel-Pais), [DZone](https://dzone.com/users/879943/manuelpais@gmail.com.html), [TechBeacon](https://techbeacon.com/contributors/manuel-pais)) on DevOps and Continuous Delivery. 

Co-author of the upcoming book [Team Guide to Software Releasability](https://skeltonthatcher.com/publications/team-guide-software-releasability) (expected release in first half 2018).

## Why Me?

I come from a diverse technical background which helps me **understand different teams point of view** in the software delivery chain. 

Started off as Java **developer** in 2000 for online commerce, moved to **build management** roles both in the Telecom and Aviation sectors, embraced test automation and led **QA** teams until 2014. 

Part of the DevOps movement since 2011, was [recruited by InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com/author/Manuel-Pais) (non professionally) to lead their [DevOps coverage](https://www.infoq.com/devops).

Spent the last years helping clients adopt **DevOps** and accelerate their **Delivery** chain across a **range of industries** (**finance, legal, telecom, manufacturing**). Mostly medium to large international organizations (UK, China, Portugal).

## Writing

Here are some examples of articles I've written for [InfoQ](https://www.infoq.com/profile/Manuel-Pais), [DZone](https://dzone.com/users/879943/manuelpais@gmail.com.html), [TechBeacon](https://techbeacon.com/contributors/manuel-pais) where I share my learnings from working with clients across diverse industries.



[How to increase enterprise collaboration and speed in your DevOps pipeline](https://techbeacon.com/how-increase-enterprise-collaboration-speed-your-devops-pipeline)

> We can take DevOps collaboration beyond IT (some call it [BizDevOps](http://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/essentialguide/Why-and-how-BizDevOps-is-going-to-change-everything)) by mapping the full value stream, identifying the biggest bottlenecks today, and improving collaboration between teams inside and outside IT.



[Continuous Delivery anti-patterns](https://dzone.com/articles/continuous-delivery-anti-patterns)

> The idea that you can “just plug in a deployment pipeline” and get the benefits of CD is a common anti-pattern.



[Securing a Continuous Delivery pipeline](https://dzone.com/articles/securing-a-continuous-delivery-pipeline)

> Automating security checks triggers conversations between developers, testers, and security folks. They get everyone on the same page, promote knowledge sharing, and establish common grounds and testable criteria for moving a candidate release through the deployment pipeline.
